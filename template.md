# Sales Letter Template

## 1. Get attention
* How to [x].
* Secrets of [x] revealed!
* Warning! Don't even think of [x] until you [y].

## 2. Identify the Problem
* There’s nothing worse than [trying to do something and having it not work]. [When the thing you're trying to doesn't work, it's the WORST because of x, y, & z. When you finally fix the problem, you realize that new problems have arisen that you now have to fix. SUCH A BUMMER].
* [Describe the problem.] [Describe all the additional problems created by the initial problem.]

## 3. Provide the Solution
* [There’s no need for the reader to struggle through all those problems because your product or service will solve it for them.]

## 4. Present your Credentials
* Successful case studies.
* Prestigious companies (or people) you have done business with.
* The length of time you’ve been in your field of expertise
* Conferences where you have spoken
* Important awards or recognitions

**Note:** Your reader should get the impression after reading this section that “you’ve been there and done that” with great success and that the reader can expect the same results.

## 5. Show the Benefits
* [Benefit 1]
* [Benefit 2]
* [Benefit 3]
* [Benefit n]

**Note:** List as many benefits as possible that can be derived from your product/service. Sort them from biggest to smallest impact.

## 6. Give Social Proof
* [Testimonial 1 validating Benefit 1]
* [Testimonial 2 validating Benefit 2]
* [Testimonial 3 validating Benefit 3]
* [Testimonial n validating Benefit n]

**Note:** Make your testimonial even more powerful include pictures of your customers with their names and addresses (at least the city and state). You might even ask if you can use their phone number.  Most readers won’t call but it is a powerful statement to include their complete contact information.  It demonstrates that you are real and so are the testimonials.

## 7. Make Your Offer
### Notes
* Your offer should be irresistible.
* You want your reader to say to themselves, “I’d be stupid not to take advantage of this deal.”
* Your offer can come in many different formats.  The best offers are usually an attractive combination of price, terms, and free gifts. For example, if you were selling a car your offer might be a discounted retail price, low interest rate, and a free year of gas.
* **Hint:** When developing your offer you should always try to raise the value of your offer by adding on products or services rather than lowering your price. Include vivid explanations of the benefits of the additional products or services you are offering in order to raise the perceived value of your offer.

## 8. Give a Guarantee
[Offer a money back guarantee]
[Offer something that eliminates as much risk as possible, if not all risk]

### Notes
* **Example:** "100%, No Questions Asked, Take-It-To-The-Bank Guarantee"
* **Hint:** Your offer may be so good that people won’t believe it.  You’ve heard the old axiom, “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”  To avoid this thinking, give the reason why you can give such as great offer. When people read the reason why, it will help them reconcile your irresistible offer in their mind and make it more believable.

## 9. Inject Scarcity
* If you purchase by [date] you will get the entire set of free bonuses
* Our supply is limited to only 50 [product or service] and will be sent to you on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.  After they are gone there won’t be any more available.
* This offer is only good until [future date] after which the [product or service] will return to its original price.

### Notes
* You can create a feeling of scarcity by telling your reader that either the quantity is in limited supply or that your offer is valid for only a limited time period.
* One word of caution: If you make an offer you need to live up to it.  If you go back on your word after the deadline date you will begin to erode the trust and confidence your customers have come to expect from you.

## 10. Call to action
* Pick Up the Phone and Call Now!
* Tear Off the Order Form and Send It In Today!
* Come to Our Store by Friday and [x]

### Notes
* Be explicit and succinct in your instructions.
* Plant your call to action throughout your letter.

## 11. Give a Warning
### Notes
* A good sales letter will continue to build emotion, right up to the very end.
* Tell the reader what would happen if they didn’t take advantage of your offer.  Perhaps they would continue to:
 * Struggle day to day to make ends meet
 * Work too hard just to get a few customers
 * Lose the opportunity to receive all your valuable bonuses
 * Keep getting what they’ve always got
 * Watch other companies get all the business
* Try to paint a graphic picture in the mind of the reader about the consequences of not taking action now. Remind them just how terrible their current state is and that it just doesn’t have to be that way.

## 12. Close with a Reminder
### Notes
* Always include a postscript (P.S.).In your postscript you want to remind them of your irresistible offer.  If you’ve used scarcity in your sales letter, include your call to action then remind them of the limited time (or quantity) offer.

## Extra notes:
1.  **Write the Features/Benefits:** The biggest hurdle to writing a great sales letter is just getting started.  Many people have a fear of writing.  One way to get your letter started and develop a helpful guide for your letter is to write a feature/benefit list.
 > _Take a set of 3 x 5 cards and write all the features you know about on one side of the cards.  Then turn the cards over and write a benefit for each feature.  You’ll have started your letter and produced a list of benefits you can use to write it._

2. **Once you have completed the letter, let it sit for a day or so.**  This will allow you to be more objective you when you edit your letter.  If you’ve just spent the last few hours working on it you will find it hard to catch the mistakes or edits in the letter because you’re just too close to it.

3. **Develop a “swipe file” to help get your creative juices flowing.**  When you see a great ad or receive a particularly effective letter in the mail, keep it in a file that you can refer back to again and again.  Companies pay thousands of dollars to develop their marketing materials; you might as well take advantage of that by using it as a model for your own work.

4. **Before you start writing your sales letter, develop a customer profile sheet by documenting every thing you know about your target customer.**  Some great copywriters put a picture of a typical customer in front of them as they write to help them remember to whom they are writing the letter.

5. **A sales letter should be as long as it needs to be.**  Each part of your sales letter should be building your case.  If it takes ½ page to build your case then that’s how long your letter should be; however, I use a 24-page sales letter to successfully sell one of my products.

Make sure that you include each of the steps because each step builds your case in a unique way and adds to the reader’s emotions.
